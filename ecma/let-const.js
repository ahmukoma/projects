/* 1. - What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***? */

/* The difference between 'var' and 'let' is that 'var' is attached to the 'window' of the browser, 
can be redeclared, and referenced before being assigned a value. */

/* 2. - What is the difference between **var** and ***const***? */

/* While 'var' can be redeclared and reassigned, 'const' has to be assigned a value at declaration. */

/* 3. - What is the difference between **let** and **const**? */

/* Though both function similarly in almost every aspect, 'const' can't be reassigned a value, it has to remain 'constant.' */

/* 4. - What is hoisting? */
/* 'Hoisting' refers to 'moving' a variable with a type 'var' to the top of a programming list, assigning it a value of 'undefined.' */
